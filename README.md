It is necessary to set bombs to clear the cells on the game field, to find bonuses (increasing a number of simultaneously placed bombs and the power of the bomb's explosion). To win, you must kill by the bomb the another player.
The game only has a mode player versus player. The single player mode is not implemented (when you choose a single game, the final cutscene is played)
